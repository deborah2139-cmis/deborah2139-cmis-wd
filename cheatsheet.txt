Final Project:
- nav, main = side by side
- nav = width:#px;
- nav = float:left;
- main = margin-left:#px;
- float and margin should be the same (right-right & left-left)
- img = float:right;
- footer = clear:both; = not allow things to float to the right/left
- br.clear = clear:both;
- br class="clear"
